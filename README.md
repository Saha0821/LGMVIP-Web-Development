# LGMVIP-Web-Development
This is my second tasks as a intern in Web Development at letsgrowmore.
I have created a web application using create react app branded as zippy.
A button in the navbar saying 'Users' makes an API call to get the user data.
I have used  https://reqres.in/api/users?page=1 to get the data.
A loader will be displayed while the API fetches the data.
